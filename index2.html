       <pre>Here is a little bit about me,
       I really enjoy coding, I have been learning more and more everyday and love it.
       I have a son who is under a year old and is growing faster and faster everyday. 
       I am happily married and we are going into our 3rd year soon. 
       I am currently the Landscaping supervisor at a school, but my heart is in the web. 
       I am looking for a new job so if you want an entry level dev, please teach me stuff!!!
